Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

Output: Intersected at '8'

**1. We can Check for Brut force approach to solve it, but its become more complexfor larger sized linkedlist**

**2. Next we can conside Hash table, LL1 is added to the hash table and compare it with LL2, in which node the LL1 in the hash table matches with LL2, return that node as intersection.  We can reduce the time complexity to O(1) but space is increasing according to input size O(n).**

### Algorithm
**Put a head pointer on both linked list and start from the same nodeLength in which point both head Pointer become same it is the intersection node**

```javascript
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    let lengthA =getListLength(headA);
    let lengthB =getListLength(headB);

    while(lengthA>lengthB){
        lengthA--;
        headA = headA.next;
    }
    while(lengthB>lengthA){
        lengthB--;
        headB = headB.next;
    }
    while(headA!==headB){
        headA = headA.next;
        headB = headB.next;
    }
    return headA
};
function getListLength(head) {
    let len = 0;
    while (head !== null) {
        len++;
        head = head.next;
    }
    return len;
}
```

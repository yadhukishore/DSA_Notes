# Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` of length `n`.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is `1` while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is `3`.

You need to divide `nums` into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,12]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: `[1]`, `[2]`, and `[3,12]` at a total cost of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.  
The other possible ways to form 3 subarrays are:
- `[1]`, `[2,3]`, and `[12]` at a total cost of `1 + 2 + 12 = 15`.
- `[1,2]`, `[3]`, and `[12]` at a total cost of `1 + 3 + 12 = 16`.

## Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [5,4,3]`  
**Output:** `12`  
**Explanation:** The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: `[5]`, `[4]`, and `[3]` at a total cost of `5 + 4 + 3 = 12`.
It can be shown that `12` is the minimum cost achievable.

## Example 3:

**Input:** `nums = [10,3,1,1]`  
**Output:** `12`  
**Explanation:** The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: `[10,3]`, `[1]`, and `[1]` at a total cost of `10 + 1 + 1 = 12`.
It can be shown that `12` is the minimum cost achievable.

### Solution:-

This code aims to divide an array into three disjoint contiguous subarrays such that the sum of the costs of these subarrays is minimized. Here's a simpler explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We initialize two variables `min1` and `min2` to `Infinity`. These variables will store the two smallest values encountered in the input array `nums`.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - Starting from index 1 (as we already consider the first element of the array), we iterate through the elements of the input array `nums`.
   - For each element at index `i`, we compare it with the current values of `min1` and `min2`.
   - If the element at index `i` is less than `min1`, we update `min1` and shift the previous value of `min1` to `min2`.
   - If the element at index `i` is not less than `min1` but less than `min2`, we update `min2`.

3. **Return the minimum cost**:
   - After iterating through the array, we return the sum of the first element of the array `nums` (as it's the cost of the first subarray) along with `min1` and `min2`.
   - This sum represents the minimum possible sum of costs of three disjoint contiguous subarrays.

```javascript
var minimumCost = function(nums) {
 let min1=Infinity,min2=Infinity
 for(let i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
     if(nums[i]<min1){
         min2=min1
         min1=nums[i]
     }else if(nums[i]<min2){
         min2=nums[i]
     }
 }
 return nums[0]+min1+min2
};

```

its like our finding second min value in the array!!!!

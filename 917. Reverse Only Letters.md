# 917. Reverse Only Letters

Given a string s, reverse the string according to the following rules:

- All the characters that are not English letters remain in the same position.
- All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.
Return s after reversing it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
Example 3:

Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"

### Algo:-

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- You split the string `s` into an array of characters.
- You initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the beginning and end of the array.
- You define a regex pattern `regex` that matches any letter.
- In the `while` loop, you check if the characters at the `start` and `end` positions match the regex pattern.
- If the character at `start` doesn't match the regex (meaning it's not a letter), you increment `start`.
- If the character at `end` doesn't match the regex (meaning it's not a letter), you decrement `end`.
- If both characters are letters, you swap them and move the pointers towards the center of the array.
- Once the loop is done, you join the array back into a string and return it.

This approach ensures that only the letters in the string are reversed, while all other characters maintain their original positions in the string.

```javascript
var reverseOnlyLetters = function(s) {
    s = s.split('');
    let start = 0;
    let end = s.length - 1;
    const regex = /[a-zA-Z]/g; 
    while (start < end) {
        if (s[start].match(regex) === null) { // not a letter at the start, continue without swapping
            start++; 
            continue;
        }
        if (s[end].match(regex) === null) { // not a letter at the end, continue without swapping
            end--; 
            continue;
        }
        let tmp = s[start]; // we end up here when there are letters at 'start' and 'end' so we just swap them
        s[start] = s[end];
        s[end] = tmp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    
    return s.join('');
};
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we iterate through the string once to reverse only the letters while skipping non-letter characters.

The space complexity is also O(n) because we convert the input string into an array of characters in order to manipulate it.

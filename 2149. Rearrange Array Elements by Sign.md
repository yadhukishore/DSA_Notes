# 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].

## Algorithm
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code initializes an empty array `result` to store the rearranged elements.
   - It also initializes an object `index` with two properties: `pos` and `neg`, representing the indices where positive and negative numbers will be stored in the `result` array.

2. **Iterating through the input array**:
   - It iterates through each element `num` of the input array `nums`.
   - For each element, it determines its sign (`pos` for positive or `neg` for negative) using a ternary operator.

3. **Assigning elements to the result array**:
   - Based on the sign of the current element, it assigns the element to the appropriate index in the `result` array using the `index` object.
   - If the element is positive, it assigns it to the index specified by `index.pos`, and then increments `index.pos` by 2.
   - If the element is negative, it assigns it to the index specified by `index.neg`, and then increments `index.neg` by 2.

4. **Returning the rearranged array**:
   - After iterating through all elements of the input array, the function returns the rearranged `result` array.

This algorithm rearranges the elements of the input array such that all positive numbers appear first (in the order they appear in the input array) followed by all negative numbers (also in the order they appear in the input array).

For example, given the input array `[3, -2, 1, -4, 0]`, the output would be `[3, 1, -2, -4, 0]`, where positive numbers are placed first, followed by negative numbers.



### This code utilizes an object as a form of hash table to keep track of the indices where positive and negative numbers should be placed in the `result` array.

Here's how the object `{pos: 0, neg: 1}` functions as a hash table:

- The keys `pos` and `neg` represent the signs of the numbers (`pos` for positive and `neg` for negative).
- The corresponding values indicate the next available index in the `result` array where a number of that sign should be placed.

For example:
- Initially, `index.pos` is set to 0, indicating that the next positive number should be placed at index 0 in the `result` array.
- Similarly, `index.neg` is set to 1, indicating that the next negative number should be placed at index 1 in the `result` array.

As the algorithm iterates through the input array, it uses these index values to assign positive and negative numbers to the appropriate indices in the `result` array. After each assignment, it increments the corresponding index value to ensure that the next number of that sign is placed at the next available index.

In summary, while the code doesn't directly use a traditional hash table data structure, it uses an object as a makeshift hash table to efficiently keep track of the indices where positive and negative numbers should be placed.

```javascript
function rearrange(nums){
    const result=[];
    const index={
        pos:0,
        neg:1
    };
    let sign;
    for(val of nums){
        if(val>0){
            sign='pos';
        }else{
            sign='neg';
        }
        result[index[sign]]=val;
        index[sign]+=2;
    }
    return result;
}
console.log(rearrange([-4,-2,-1,7,8,9]))
```

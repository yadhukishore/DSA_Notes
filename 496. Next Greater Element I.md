# 496. Next Greater Element I
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 
### CODE:-



```javascript
var nextGreaterElement = function(nums1, nums2) {
    let map = {};
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
        let curr = nums2[i];
        
        while (curr > stack[stack.length - 1]) {
            let popped = stack.pop();
            map[popped] = curr;
        }
        
        stack.push(curr);
    }
    
    let res = [];
    
    for (let num of nums1) {
        if (map[num]) {
            res.push(map[num]);
        } else {
            res.push(-1);
        }
    }
    
    return res;
};
```

### Explanation of the code:

1. Initialize an empty object `map` to store the next greater elements.
2. Initialize an empty array `stack`.
3. Iterate through `nums2`:
   - For each element `curr` in `nums2`, compare it with the top element of the stack (`stack[stack.length - 1]`).
   - If `curr` is greater than the top element of the stack, pop elements from the stack and update the `map` with the next greater element until `curr` is not greater than the top element of the stack. This step effectively finds the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
   - Push the current element `curr` onto the stack.
4. After processing all elements in `nums2`, we have populated the `map` object with the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
5. Iterate through `nums1`:
   - For each element `num` in `nums1`, check if it exists as a key in the `map`.
   - If `num` exists in the `map`, push its corresponding next greater element from the `map` into the result array `res`.
   - If `num` does not exist in the `map`, push `-1` into the result array `res`.
6. Finally, return the result array `res`.

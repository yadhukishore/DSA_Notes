# Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

## Example 1:

**Input:** `head = [1,2,2,1]`  
**Output:** `true`

## Example 2:

**Input:** `head = [1,2]`  
**Output:** `false`

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

## Follow up:

Could you do it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?

## First approach

**We can solve it by using a Stack, where we itreate the LinkedList till middle and add all the itreated value to the stack!**

**After reaching the middle, In the next itreation if the value in the LinkedList get same with the value the value in the Stack POP() the Stack.**

**if the Stack Get empty return true else false(Palindrome).**

*There is a problem*

**We are already travesing the LL fully once O(n) and the and also adding to the stack According to the inputLL the space is also in O(n), it is not a better way**
### We can optimise it by another way!
1. **First find the mid of LL by twoPointer Technique!, so the slow Pointer will be the mid now!**
2. **Reverse all the elements from the Slow Pointer**
3. **After reversing Now we have 2 LL, Now put the Slow pointer in the Reversed LL**
4. **Till the slow pointer gets Null  itreate both LL, if the Value not become Equal at any point Its not a Pallindrom So return false;**

```javaScript

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(head) {
if(head === null || head.next === null) return true;
var slow = head;
var fast = head;
while(fast.next !== null && fast.next.next !== null){
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
}//now Slow is in the mid;
//we can reverse all the eles after mid;
slow.next=reverseList(slow.next);
//Aftering reversing the mid LL we can Put slow Pointer in the New LL
slow = slow.next;
while(slow !== null){
    if(head.val !== slow.val){//check isSame Both LL completly
         return false;
    }
    head = head.next;
    slow = slow.next;
  
}
  return true;
}

// Function to reverse a linked list
function reverseList(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let curr = head;
    
    while (curr !== null) {
        let nextTemp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextTemp;
    }
    
    return prev;
}
```

now the complexity:-`O(n)` time and `O(1)` space

In this **Trie** implementation:

- `TrieNode` represents each node in the trie. It contains a map (`children`) to store references to child nodes and a boolean flag (`isEndOfWord`) to indicate whether the node marks the end of a word.
- `Trie` represents the trie data structure. It has methods `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` to insert words into the trie, search for complete words, and check for prefixes, respectively.
- The `insert` method iterates through each character of the word and creates child nodes as needed.
- The `search` method checks if a word exists in the trie by traversing through the nodes corresponding to each character of the word.
- The `startsWith` method checks if any word in the trie has the given prefix by traversing through the nodes corresponding to each character of the prefix.

```javascript
class TrieNode {
    constructor() {
        this.children = new Map(); // Map to store child nodes
        this.isEndOfWord = false; // Flag to mark the end of a word
    }
}

class Trie {
    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode(); // Root node of the trie
    }

    // Function to insert a word into the trie
    insert(word) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (let char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
            }
            node = node.children.get(char);
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true; // Mark the end of the word
    }

    // Function to search for a word in the trie
    search(word) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (let char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                return false; // If any character is not found, the word doesn't exist
            }
            node = node.children.get(char);
        }
        return node.isEndOfWord; // Return true if the end of the word is reached
    }

    // Function to check if a word has any prefix in the trie
    startsWith(prefix) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (let char of prefix) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                return false; // If any character is not found, the prefix doesn't exist
            }
            node = node.children.get(char);
        }
        return true; // Return true if the prefix is found
    }
}

// Example usage:
const trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
console.log(trie.search("apple")); // Output: true
console.log(trie.search("app")); // Output: false
console.log(trie.startsWith("app")); // Output: true
trie.insert("app");
console.log(trie.search("app")); // Output: true
```
 Let's break down the `insert(word)` method of the Trie data structure into simple steps:

1. **Start at the Root Node**: We begin at the root node of the Trie.

2. **Iterate Over Characters in the Word**: For each character in the input word:
   - Check if the current character exists as a child of the current node.
   - If it doesn't exist, create a new node for that character and add it as a child of the current node.

3. **Move to the Next Node**: Move to the child node corresponding to the current character. This becomes the new current node for the next iteration.

4. **Mark End of Word**: After iterating through all characters of the word, mark the `isEndOfWord` flag of the last node as `true` to indicate that this node represents the end of a word.

5. **Repeat for Each Word**: Repeat these steps for each word that needs to be inserted into the Trie.

Let's illustrate this with an example:
Suppose we want to insert the word "apple" into the Trie.

- We start at the root node.
- For each character in "apple" (i.e., 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e'):
  - We check if the current node has a child node corresponding to the current character. If not, we create a new node for that character.
  - We move to the child node corresponding to the current character.
- After processing all characters, we mark the `isEndOfWord` flag of the last node (i.e., the node corresponding to 'e') as `true`, indicating that "apple" has been fully inserted into the Trie.

This way, the Trie structure is built up as we insert words, allowing efficient word retrieval, prefix search, and other operations.




#  find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings


1. **Initialization**: It starts by initializing a pointer `node` to the root of the Trie and an empty string `prefix` to store the longest common prefix found so far.

2. **Traversing the Trie**:
   - It iterates through the Trie as long as two conditions are met:
     - The number of children of the current node is 1 (meaning there is only one possible continuation).
     - The current node is not the end of a word (meaning it's not a complete word).
   - If both conditions are met, it means there is a common character among all words so far. It appends that character to the `prefix` and moves the `node` pointer to its child corresponding to that character.

3. **Returning the Prefix**: Once the loop terminates (either because the conditions are no longer met or the end of the Trie is reached), it returns the `prefix`, which represents the longest common prefix among all words in the Trie.

This method leverages the Trie's structure to efficiently find the longest common prefix among a set of strings by traversing only the common prefix characters. It runs in linear time complexity relative to the length of the longest common prefix.

Let's see how it works with the provided examples:
- For `strs1 = ["flower","flow","floight"]`, the longest common prefix is "fl".
- For `strs2 = ["dog","racecar","car"]`, there is no common prefix, so the result is an empty string ("").
```javascript

class TrieNode {
 constructor() {
    this.children = new Map();
    this.isEndOfWord = false;
 }
}

class Trie {
 constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
 }
  
 insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      const char = word[i];
      if (!node.children.has(char)) {
        node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
      }
      node = node.children.get(char);
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true;
 }
 longestCommonPrefix(){
     let node = this.root;
     let prefix = "";
     while(node.children.size === 1 && !node.isEndOfWord){
         const char = node.children.keys().next().value;
         prefix += char;
         node = node.children.get(char);
     }
     return prefix;
 }
}
function longestCommonPrefix(strs){
    if(strs.length === 0 || strs === null) return "";
    const trie = new Trie();
    for(let val of strs){
        trie.insert(val);
    }
    return trie.longestCommonPrefix();
}
// Example usage
const strs1 = ["flower","flow","floight"];
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(strs1)); // Output: "fl"

const strs2 = ["dog","racecar","car"];
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(strs2)); // Output: ""

```
In the line `const char = node.children.keys().next().value;`, `node.children.keys()` retrieves all the keys (characters) of the children nodes of the current node in the Trie. This returns an iterator object representing the keys.

Then, `next()` is called on this iterator object, which returns an object with two properties: `done` (a boolean indicating if the iterator is done) and `value` (the next value in the iteration). In this case, `value` holds the next character in the iteration.

So, `const char` captures the value of the next character (key) in the Trie's children nodes, which represents the next character in the longest common prefix.
